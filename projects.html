                    <h1 class="text-h1"><span>Calculator</span></h1>
                    <p>This basic calculator project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a working calculator with simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The HTML structure includes an input field to display numbers and results, along with buttons for each number, operation, and functions like clear, delete, and equals. CSS styling gives the calculator a clean look, with centered buttons and a dark theme.<p>

                        <h1 class="text-h1"><span>To do list</span></h1>
                        <p>I built a simple To-Do List app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! Users can add tasks by typing them in and clicking "Add." Tasks show up in a list where you can click to mark them as done (with a strikethrough) and delete them when they're complete. The JavaScript code handles adding, marking, and deleting tasks, and with a clean layout in CSS, the app is easy to use. A quick and fun project for organizing daily tasks.</p>
